      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Martin — a motivated and detail-oriented professional passionate about technology, design, and solving problems through creative solutions. I am a Customer Service Representative at Group1001. Bringing a unique blend of technical knowledge and customer service experience. Originally from Indianapolis, Indiana, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Informatics with a concentration in Human-Centered Computing from Indiana University. My academic background and professional experience have equipped me with a strong foundation in technology, client support, and human resources. I have contributed to diverse organizations, including providing technical and product support at Group1001 and overseeing recruitment and HR operations at the Applied Behavior Center for Autism. These roles have allowed me to blend technical expertise with a commitment to exceptional service, driving meaningful and people-focused solutions. Beyond my professional endeavors, I am deeply engaged in community service. I actively participate in environmental cleanups and volunteer construction projects, including initiatives through Keep Indianapolis Beautiful and other workplace-sponsored programs. I am passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact—both in the workplace and in the community. </p>
